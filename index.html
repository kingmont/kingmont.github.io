				<h2>The Property Tax Experts</h2>
	      <p>
	        Kingmont Consulting, Professional Corporation is a full service assessment and property tax consulting firm that specializes in providing taxpayers of commercial, industrial and special purpose properties with full-range property assessment and tax management services.
	      </p>
	      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
	      <p>
	        "Providing our valued customers with small firm customer service and familiarity, in partnership with large firm experience and expertise."
	      </p>
	      <h2>The Kingmont Consulting Advantage</h2>
	      <p>
	        Kingmont is committed to ensuring that any property tax savings achieved on behalf of our clients are not simply replaced by the consulting and litigation costs incurred to achieve the tax savings.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	        Unlike many of our competitors, we do not pay our staff based on the quantity of their billings. Rather, we are focused on sustaining long-term relationships with our clients, which we believe is contingent upon their receipt of fees that are both justified and cost effective.
	      </p>
	      <h2>Our Experience</h2>
	      <p>
	        Kingmont principals and staff have well over a century of combined experience in the ever changing legislative landscape of current value assessment and municipal taxation. On the tax calculation side, our team has lived and flourished surrounded by the fluid nature of the property taxation rules which continue to follow the many incarnations of the <i>Assessment Act</i> and the <i>Municipal Act</i>.

				<h2>About Us</h2>
	      <p>
			    Kingmont was founded in 1988 by Edward Ford-King and David Montgomery. After years at the Ministry of Finance and the regional municipal level, they decided it was time for a change. Today, Kingmont has a team of associates who provide their valued customers with small firm customer service and familiarity, in partnership with large firm experience and expertise. This has allowed Kingmont to become one of the most respected property tax consulting firms in Canada today.
			  </p>
	      <p>
		        Kingmont's growth strategy over the years has been simple; attract only experienced and highly dedicated associates who share our core values and work ethics. This has allowed Kingmont to grow through word of mouth recommendations from their existing client base. Further, Kingmont's success can be directly attributed to our commitment to provide an exceptional customer service experience for our clients.
			  </p>
	      <p>
		        Kingmont has made it our business to keep abreast of the changes in legislation and the administration of municipal taxation. All of our associates, including the principals, are regularly involved in seminars and industry sponsored events. Additionally, we are required to attend yearly Continuing Professional Development classes provided by the Law Society of Upper Canada.

				<h2>Meet the Licensed Paralegal Team</h2>
				<h3>Principal - Robert (Bob) Ford-King</h3>
				<p>Bob graduated from Queen's University with a background in economics and statistics before moving into the assessment industry. With far more years working in our industry than he cares to admit, Bob has made countless presentations before the Assessment Review Board on matters of assessment and municipal taxation. It is amazing that he still has a sense of humour.</p>
				<h3>Managing Partner - Tracey Coleman</h3>
				<p>Tracey is Kingmont's managing partner. She is involved in the day to day management of operations and focuses her "extra" time on Municipal tax issues and recoveries on behalf of our clients.</p>
				<h3>Chief Advisor, Associate - Edward (Ed) Ford-King</h3>
				<p>Ed won't let us tell you about his experience. So let's just say that he is one of the most experienced consultants in Ontario. Ed takes a hands on approach to assessment review. His knowledge and understanding of industrial properties sets an industry standard. He is constantly before the Assessment Review Board and the Farmland Tribunal seeking fair assessments for our clients.</p>
				<h3>Associate - Raquel Henry</h3>
				<p>With over fifteen years of experience in the industry, Raquel works closely with municipalities, assessment offices, and the Assessment Review Board. Raquel has immeasurable patience with her responsibilities as municipal liaison and managing municipal expectations. It is also thanks to Raquel that we can manage the enormous amount of data in our paperless society.</p>
				<h3>Associate - Peter Senior</h3>
				<p>Peter is a man of great poise and patience. His career in assessment began with the Ministry of Finance and what is now the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation. He works with Kingmont as a senior consultant with responsibilities ranging from commercial to industrial properties. Peter acts as both an expert witness and a client advocate, and by some miracle he never raises his voice!</p>
				<h3>Associate - David Montgomery</h3>
				<p>Dave's natural ability to review and process large quantities of data is something to behold. But it is not Dave's analytical skills that make him one of Kingmont's greatest assets, it is his natural charm and his love of life.</p>
				<p></p>
				<h3>Consultant - Bryan Sullivan</h3>
				<p>Bryan is our newest team member. He brings to Kingmont his energy and inquisitive nature. He focuses on review and analysis of assessment data, large scale research projects and tax applications.</p>
